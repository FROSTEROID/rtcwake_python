# rtcwake_python
Calling rtcwake through Python. 
Gigving it a H:M time to make the pc get up at that time.
Aliased it with "wakeme". So i just write "wakeme 7:35", and PC goes asleep and wakes up at the specified time.
The Python script calculates seconds count between the moment (H:M) of running and the desired time passed as an arg.
It's inaccurate. I ignored seconds so the error is +- a minute.
